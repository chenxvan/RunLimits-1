# RunLimits

This documents explains how to perform the MLF and get the limits using Combine.

The analysis is done in different steps: 

#### Create templates for combine ####
#### Create datacard and workspace for combine ####
#### Rebin the histograms such that the error per bin is 30% ####
#### MLF TO THE SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES ####
#### Get post-fit distributions #### 

createtemplates.sh contains the order of the scripts. Almost all the scripts are to create the templates. Once the templates are done and the datacard is fine, running combine it takes few steps.
